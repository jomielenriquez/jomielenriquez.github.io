# My Website.
This is the repository for my website. It is written in javascript, html, and css. I will be described in many areas of it, including those about me, my work, other projects, and my certifications.

## About me
This section is all about my present and former employers, and it lists every position and job responsibility that has ever been assigned to me. Additionally, it will outline my job during that time.

## Projects
My prior work will be displayed in the projects section, albeit not all may be works. Some of them rank among my greatest accomplishments as a software engineer or developer.

## Other Projects
I also made little side projects for fun. Some of those will be shown in the section titled "Other Projects." My work is not limited to those. My other little efforts are private.

## Certificates
The certificate section shows a few of my certificates. These are my software development-related certificates.
