# OOP

## Class
 A class is a blueprint used to generate a collection of homogenous products, referred to as objects.

## Object
 - An object is a instantiated class.
 - Objects in real-life have state and behaviour. eg. Laptops have states (name, colour, processors) and behaviour (ON, OFF, Audio, Video).
 - An entity with a clearly defined structure and behaviour is called an object.
 - Objects in OOPs can include variable, data structure, function or method.

## Abstraction
 Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.
 - The main goal of abstraction is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.
 - Abstraction is related to both encapsulation and data hiding.

 ### Abstraction in real world
    I’m a coffee addict. So, when I wake up in the morning, I go into my kitchen, switch on the coffee machine and make coffee. Sounds familiar?

    Making coffee with a coffee machine is a good example of abstraction.

    You need to know how to use your coffee machine to make coffee. You need to provide water and coffee beans, switch it on and select the kind of coffee you want to get.

    The thing you don’t need to know is how the coffee machine is working internally to brew a fresh cup of delicious coffee. You don’t need to know the ideal temperature of the water or the amount of ground coffee you need to use.

    Someone else worried about that and created a coffee machine that now acts as an abstraction and hides all these details. You just interact with a simple interface that doesn’t require any knowledge about the internal implementation.

 ### Abstraction in OOP
    Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. Similar to the coffee machine in your kitchen, you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and which input parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation. But you don’t need to understand how this method is implemented and which kinds of actions it has to perform to create the expected result.
